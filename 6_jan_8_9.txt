  Programming ? 
      set of instructions.
      low level-high level 
      Python - high level 

  function - perform some specific task
            - build in / user defined 

  print -- end --
          sep  --

data types and variables 
    which kind of data we want to store 
    numeric ,string , collection
    1. int  - age 
    2. float - decimal eg percetange
    3. str - string eg name
    4. colllection - list,tuple,set
    5. map - dictionary

variables --- indetifier , where we are storing the value
        eg. age 
            name
            to_do_list
      case-sensitive means age and Age not equal 
      print  -Print


      age =20  - age is variable 20 is value , value is numeric/int
      name="dharmishtha" name is variable , value is dharmishtha it's string 
      to_do_list = ['sleeping','shopping'] value is sleeping/shopping it's list

10th Jan

Variable
data type

type()  --- 

age=20
name="dharmishtha"
per=70.45

int age=20;
string name="dharmishtha"

--- To accept value from user we have to use input()

  function ----To perfrom specific task 
                1. built in  (print(), input(),type()
                2. user defined 
  function have paramter and return something
1. parameters ---type(varaible) , print(variable,string) 
2. return--- type class name ,input--string


age  --- int
percentage ---float
type conversion/casting

Lab task :   use f
            using input function enter student data like name,age,marks,percetange,addresss and print it 
            Proper formate

 -- accept 2 numbers from user and add those numbers and display sum
  1. accept 2 numbers from user
  2. add those numbers 
3. display sum

--accept 2 string from user and append/contact 

casting /conversion from one data type to another 
int
float



sum of 12 and 90 is 102 

Lab Task : read operators ,perform all the programs

17th Jan 

find area of Rectangle 
length*bredth

Operators 
   - 7 types 
   formulas 
   arithmatic


ARITHMATIC --- + , - , * , /(division) , %(modulus reminder) , ** (exponent) , // (floor division)
       %          /  
4/2  = 0          2
10/5  = 0         2
11/5  = 0.5      2.1
12/6  = 0        2
100/6 = 4        16. 


2 raise to 4 == 16   2**4
3 raise to 4 ===81   3**4
2 raise to 7 ==      2**7

12 power 5

Membership Operator --- in , not in

Lab Task : use in and not in with lst_names 

identity operator --- is , not is

CONDITIONAL STMT
  -- if    --- 
        number positive 
        if condition:
            block_of_code


Enter age from user and check user is adult or not
>18
  --if else
  -- if elif

Lab task : read conditional stmt

24th Jan 

-->No is Positive negative
-->No is odd/even

no%2==0

enter 2 numbers from user and print greatest number

--- age == 0-2 --infant
           3-18 -- minor
          19 - 50 - adult
          51 - 70 - seniour
          above 70 - super seniur 

GIT hub
Read -- nested if and loops 

27th Jan
  -- GIT Hub 
  -- Nested if (if within if)

if condition:
    if condition:
      print("")

to check user is able to donate blood 1. age >18 and weight >50
2 input 

check user is eligile for licence 1. age>18 2. learning 

LabTask :  -- GIT Hub  -funda - commands - push/pull/add
           --- User enters month and your program display no of days in that month 
              eg. Enter Month --- March
                  output  --31days
                  2. Enter Month --- Feb
                  output  --- 28/29 days
          ---Check the enterd years is leap/not 
              Enter year == 2000
                            leap year
                        ==1990
